Gelatine
===========

The goal of this project is to link physical resources, mentor-people, and people-with-mentoring-needs, so that they can find each other, set up a place to meet and collaborate, and release the resources when they are done.book_a_room


## Installation (on a Mac):

Install rails ([try this ](http://www.frederico-araujo.com/2011/07/30/installing-rails-on-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-rvm-and-mysql/))

clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/mtuckerb/gelatine.git
```
hop into the repository's root 

now we need to add environment variables to allow your development box to send mail via gmail. You will use your own gmail username and password for this.

create config/local_env.yml and add
``` 
GMAIL_USERNAME: 'you@gmail.com'
GMAIL_PASSWORD: 'your_gmail_password'
```
install the gems, setup your database, and start the server.like this…
```
$ bundle install
$ rake db migrate
$ rails server &
```

to create your initial (admin) user do

```
$ rails console
user = User.create(:username => "Your Name", :password => "Your password", :email => "your@email")
user.reload
user.role = :admin
user.save!
```
You should now get an email, click the link to confirm your user and it's off to the races!

open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
